// used for cross origin communication between window objects
//Post message is a method that enables cross-origin communication between Window objects.
 // (i.e, between a page and a pop-up that it spawned, or between a page and an iframe embedded within it). 
  //Generally, scripts on different pages are allowed to access each other if and only if the pages follow same-origin policy(i.e, pages share the same protocol, port number, and host).
